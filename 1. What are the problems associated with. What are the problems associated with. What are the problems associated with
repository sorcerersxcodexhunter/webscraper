1.		What are the problems associated with N-Gram model? How are these problems handled?	
        The **N-gram model** is a statistical language model used to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words based on their probabilities. While it is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency, it has several problems. Hereâ€™s an analysis of these problems and how they are addressed:

### Problems with N-Gram Model
1. **Data Sparsity**:  
   N-gram models require a large amount of data to estimate probabilities accurately. For higher-order N-grams (e.g., trigrams or 4-grams), many possible sequences may not appear in the training data, resulting in zero probabilities for valid sequences.

2. **Fixed Context Length**:  
   N-gram models rely only on the last (N-1) words for prediction. This fixed-length context can miss long-range dependencies and ignore global context.

3. **Exponential Growth in Parameters**:  
   The number of parameters grows exponentially with the size of the vocabulary and the order of the N-gram (e.g., trigrams or 4-grams). This increases storage and computational requirements.

4. **Ambiguity in Representation**:  
   N-gram models consider only surface-level word sequences without understanding semantics or syntax, leading to ambiguities in prediction.

5. **Handling Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words**:  
   Words or sequences not seen in the training data cannot be handled effectively, leading to poor generalization.

### Solutions to N-Gram Model Problems
1. **Smoothing Techniques**:  
   To address zero probabilities due to data sparsity, various smoothing methods are used:
   - **Additive Smoothing (Laplace Smoothing)**: Adds a small constant to all counts to ensure no zero probabilities.
   - **Good-Turing Smoothing**: Reassigns probability mass from frequent to unseen N-grams.
   - **Backoff and Interpolation**: Use lower-order N-grams (e.g., bigrams or unigrams) when higher-order N-grams have zero probabilities.

2. **Reduction in Model Order**:  
   Instead of relying on high-order N-grams, lower-order models can be combined with interpolation to balance complexity and context length.

3. **Using Larger Datasets**:  
   To mitigate data sparsity, larger and more diverse corpora are used for training. This increases the likelihood of capturing rarer N-grams.

4. **Incorporating Subword Information**:  
   For handling OOV words, techniques like character-level N-grams or byte-pair encoding (BPE) are employed. These methods break down unknown words into smaller components, enabling generalization to unseen words.

5. **Alternative Models**:  
   - **Neural Language Models (e.g., RNNs, Transformers)**: These models use word embeddings and context vectors to capture long-range dependencies and semantic relationships.
   - **Probabilistic Models**: Advanced techniques like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or Bayesian frameworks can improve handling of uncertainties.

6. **Weighting and Contextual Adjustments**:  
   Assigning weights to N-grams based on their contextual relevance or adapting to domain-specific data can enhance performance.

By leveraging these techniques, the limitations of the N-gram model are mitigated, and its practical applicability is improved.
